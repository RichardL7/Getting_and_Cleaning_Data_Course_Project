## CodeBook for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

The dataset contains:
* A 561 feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
* Its activity label.
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y, and Z directions.
